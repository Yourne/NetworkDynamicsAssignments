This repository contains some of the homework assignments I completed for the course *Network Dynamics and Learning*, which was taught by Professor F. Fagnani in early 2021 at Politecnico di Torino. I have uploaded these assignments for my own future reference.

The first assignment is a simulation of Markov chain random process over a graph.
The second assignment is a simulation of an epidemic modeled as a graph and compared with the data of the H1N1 Sweden pandemic (2009)
